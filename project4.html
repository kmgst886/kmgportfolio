    <h2>The Product</h2>
    <div class="project-image">
      <img src="IMG_3045.HEIC" alt="Product Overview">
    </div>
    <p>This product was designed to solve [problem statement] for [target audience]. It combines function with thoughtful design to create a meaningful solution.</p>
    <p>My role encompassed full product development—from concept to execution—including 3D modeling, branding, and UI mockups where necessary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container project-process">
    <h2>Development Process</h2>

    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>Initial Research</h3>
      <p>To ensure my product is positioned effectively in the current market, I conducted detailed research into the existing market segment, focusing on pricing trends and competitive offerings. I began by analyzing similar products to understand the range of price points and what customers expect at each level. This allowed me to identify gaps and opportunities within the market where my product could potentially thrive.</p>
      <p>I also examined key competitors—what they offer, how they market their products, and what value propositions they emphasize. This comparison helped me determine what features or benefits are already saturated in the market and where there might be room for innovation or differentiation.</p>
      <p>Based on this research, I identified a unique angle for my product to stand out. Rather than competing solely on price, I focused on offering a balance between affordability and enhanced features that are either missing or underdeveloped in current market offerings. By doing so, I aim to provide a product that not only meets customer expectations but also offers something new and valuable, making it more competitive and appealing in the existing landscape.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>Concept Sketching & Prototyping</h3>
      <p>During the concept development phase, I focused on bringing my ideas to life through digital sketching and visual exploration. Using Procreate, I created detailed concept drawings of both the fidget toy itself and its packaging. My goal was to ensure that the packaging wasn’t just a container, but an intentional and interactive part of the overall product experience.</p>
      <p>The sketches helped me visualize how the product would look, feel, and function. I explored different shapes, textures, and forms to maximize sensory engagement and portability—key qualities for a successful fidget toy. Simultaneously, I designed packaging concepts that complement the product’s purpose, aiming for a design that is both functional and visually appealing. For example, I considered how the packaging could double as a display case or an extension of the toy’s interactive features.</p>
      <p>This stage allowed me to refine my ideas early on, identify potential design challenges, and align the look and feel of the product with my overall brand vision. The digital prototypes were instrumental in guiding the next steps in development, from material choices to user experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>User Testing & Refinement</h3>
      <p>To ensure the product met user expectations and provided the desired experience, I conducted user testing with a group of 10 participants. Each participant was provided with a 3D model prototype of the fidget toy while they took a detailed survey. The survey was designed to gather feedback on various aspects of the product, including usability, design appeal, and overall satisfaction.</p>
      <p>The insights from the survey were invaluable. The majority of feedback focused on the functionality and enjoyment of the fidget toy itself, which confirmed that the core product design resonated well with users. Based on this positive response, I decided to retain the original toy model, ensuring that its design would remain consistent with the initial vision.</p>
      <p>However, one area for improvement that emerged from the testing was the packaging. While the toy was well-received, users noted that the unboxing experience could be more engaging. Responding to this feedback, I chose to refine the packaging design, focusing on enhancing its unboxing capability. The new packaging concept features a more intuitive, easy-to-open design that enhances the excitement of receiving the product. This change not only improves the physical experience but also aligns better with the brand’s playful and interactive image.</p>
      <p>These refinements, informed directly by user feedback, were essential in ensuring that the final product would provide a seamless and enjoyable experience from first touch to final use.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

   <div class="container project-iterations">
    <h2>First Iterations</h2>
    <p>This prototype represents the original vision for both the toy and it’s packaging. The box was designed with a fidget-friendly element and an unfolding mechanism to enhance user interaction, while also securely housing the toy. The toy itself is simplistded and was a highlight of the design. However, while the toy met expectations, the box faced issues-specifically with the hinges, which did not function as planned, resulting in problems with opening and closing.</p>

      <div class="iteration-image"><img src="IMG_3033.HEIC" alt="Iteration 1"></div>
      <div class="iteration-image"><img src="IMG_3034.HEIC" alt="Iteration 2"></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container project-iterations">
    <h2>Final Iterations</h2>
    <p>In the final version, the toy remained consistent with the first prototype-simple,durable, and featuring the successful detachable element. Major improvements were made to the box design. Building on the original concept, the unfolding feature was realized: pulling the lid now activates a mechanism that causes the box to unfold smoothly. As the design evolved, a string-pull feature added-when the user pulls the string,the box opens, enhancing both functionality and user interaction. The final version brought the original version to life with a more reliable and engaging opening mechanism.</p>
