    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="project-image">
      <img src="IMG_3056.HEIC" alt="Shipping Craze Box Cover">
    </div>
    <p><strong>Welcome To Shipping Craze</strong>a fast-paced tabletop game where players become competitive shippers. Roll dice, collect products, earn play money, and race to buy the most valuable items before the store sells out. Will you dominate the market or get left behind?</p>
    <p>The goal is to collect the highest total value in store products before the store runs out. Use your $200 wisely, earn more by collecting product cards, and land on Store spaces to make your purchases. When the store is empty, the player with the most valuable collecion wins!</p>
    <p>As the sole designer, I developed the entire game from concept to prototype: game rules, artwork, tokens, and testing strategies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container project-process">
    <h2>Development Process</h2>

    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>Game Concept & Mechanics</h3>
      <p>Shipping Craze is a competitive game where players race against each other to gather the highest value of store products before the store runs out. It’s a thrilling combination of chance, strategy, and savvy spending.</p>
      <p>How To Play</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roll the Dice: Move your marker around the board by rolling two dice on your turn.</li>
        <li>Collect Products: Land on "Pick Up a Product" spaces to collect product cards and earn play money.</li>
        <li>Shop at the Store: When you land on a Store space, you can buy items with your money and add them to your collection.</li>
        <li>Use Special Cards: Some product cards feature powerful effects that can change the game, like forcing opponents to skip their turn or making them pay you money!</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The player who collects the most valuable products before the store sells out wins the game.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <ul>
  <li>Prototyping
    <ul>
      <li>Creating Shipping Craze was an exciting journey from concept to reality. During the prototyping phase, I focused on making sure the game was engaging, easy to understand, and fun to play.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      <li>Game Board & Components 
    <ul>
      <li>The game board was carefully designed to offer a balanced and dynamic gameplay experience. Product spaces, Store spaces, and other interactive elements were positioned to encourage strategic decisions and create an exciting flow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Product Cards
    <ul>
      <li>Each of the 100 product cards showcases unique items for purchase, some with special actions that can alter gameplay. The designs were visually simple yet colorful to add a fun and lighthearted tone to the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Store Items & Play Mode
    <ul>
      <li>Store items were created with clear price tags and a simple, modern aesthetic. Play money adds a tactile element to the game, making it satisfying to collect and spend during gameplay.</li>
      <li>After building the initial digital prototypes, I moved to physical materials to ensure everything felt sturdy and would hold up during repeated use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
        
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>Playtesting & Balancing</h3>
      <p>The playtesting phase was crucial in refining Shipping Craze and ensuring it was balanced, engaging, and fun for all players. After running multiple playtests with groups of 4–6 players, I gathered valuable feedback on the game's flow, mechanics, and organization.</p>
            <ul>
  <li>Key Adjustments and Insights:
    <ul>
      <li>Gameplay Speed: Initially, some players felt the game was either too slow or too fast. To address this, I adjusted the frequency of Store spaces on the board, making sure that there were enough opportunities to purchase items while keeping the game’s pace lively.</li>
      <li>Store Item Visibility: One challenge identified during playtesting was the visibility of the store items for all players. To resolve this, I introduced a Store Item Holder, a stand that keeps the products upright and clearly visible to everyone. This made it easier for players to see the available items and their prices at all times, ensuring smooth and efficient decision-making when landing on Store spaces.</li>
      <li>Product Card and Money Organization: Another piece of feedback was that organizing product cards and play money was difficult during gameplay. To improve this, I created holders for both the Product Cards and Play Money. The Card Holder keeps the product deck neatly in place, allowing for easy access and reducing clutter. The Money Holder helps players keep their play money organized, preventing mix-ups and making it faster to track finances during the game.</li>
      <li>Item Pricing: The initial pricing of some store items was either too high or too low. Based on playtester feedback, I fine-tuned the pricing to strike a better balance, ensuring that purchases felt meaningful and added strategic depth.</li>
      <li>Special Cards: Players loved the Special Cards but felt some were too powerful. I adjusted the number and effects of these cards to add variety without letting them overpower the game’s core mechanics.</li>
      <li>Rolling Doubles: To add a layer of risk and excitement, I introduced a rule that if you roll three doubles in a row, you must forfeit your next turn. This helped prevent players from gaining too much of an advantage from lucky rolls while keeping the gameplay unpredictable and fun.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      <li>Overall Impact of Playtesting
    <ul>
      <li>The combination of these changes—along with the addition of organized holders for the store items, product cards, and play money—improved the flow of the game significantly. Players found it easier to keep track of their finances and purchases, while the improved visibility of store items allowed for more strategic decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These refinements were all made to ensure that Shipping Craze would provide a balanced, organized, and enjoyable experience that was as fun for the players at the table as it was rewarding.</li>
  </li>

  <div class="container project-iterations">
    <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
    <p>For the first iteration of Shipping Craze, I created all the game components digitally in Procreate, including the game board, product cards, and packaging design. These designs were then printed onto cardstock paper, cut out, and assembled. The prototype was very much a hands-on, DIY effort, with everything manually put together to test the basic gameplay mechanics. The components were functional, but the lack of professional finishes made it a more rough prototype for early testing.</p>

      <div class="iteration-image"><img src="IMG_2934.HEIC" alt="Store Cards"></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container project-iterations">
    <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
    <p>In the second iteration, I focused on improving the overall quality and organization of the game. All the holders, including the product card holder and money holder, were 3D modeled and printed to add a more refined, functional element to the game. The game board was a simple plain board bought from Amazon, which I customized by printing my design and pasting it onto the board. The product cards were purchased as blank cards from Amazon, and I used label sheets to print my design, which were then applied to the cards. For the chest, I bought a plain wood chest from Amazon and painted it to resemble a shipping box, adding a thematic touch to the storage. This iteration was much more polished and aimed to streamline the gameplay experience while maintaining a DIY charm.</p>

    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>Shipping Craze is currently in the late development stage. I'm finalizing manufacturing specs, refining rulebook layouts, and preparing for a potential crowdfunding campaign or publisher pitch. Then, I plan to eventually develope the game into a mobile version.</p>
